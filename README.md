# discord-mass-dm-py-selfbot
A Discord Mass Dm Self Bot Made With The Latest Version Of Selfcord.py 

---------------------

WARNINGS (READ THEM):

NEVER USE THE MASS DM TOOL WITHOUT A VPN AND HAVING ALL DISCORD TABS/APPS CLOSED! Why? Because The Self Bot Has All Intents, Having Intents Go Through The Gateway When Automating A User Account Is The Most Easiest Way To Get Detected By Discord And Get Banned From Discord Services. So Use A VPN When Selfbotting. (I Don't Think Having An Alt Account (That Was Made For Testing) Terminated Matters Too Much If You Are Gonna Test It On A Alt)


Notes:
If Your Trying To Mass Dm In A Server That Is In The Public Server List, It Will Fail Most Likely, 1. Is Because Most Of The Time, Users In Public Server's Have Their DM's Closed. And 2. Is Because It's Too Huge For The Discord API To Handle It


When The Self Bot Prints Server Information, The Server Amount Won't Appear, That Is Because Some Servers Have Loads Of Members


In Order To Get The Option To Mass Dm Every user In A Server, You Have To Join A Server Then It Will Give You The Option To Mass DM It In The Terminal
